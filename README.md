# LiverDiseaseML
In this project, I imported pandas, numpy and sklearn libraries. I used Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithms using sklearn

To run the code in your system, simply run the .py file after pasting the directory in which the file is saved in the following line in the code:

data_all = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/sachin vinaayak/Downloads/indian_liver_patient.csv') #reading the given dataset
